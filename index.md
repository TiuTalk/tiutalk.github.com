Hi! My name is {{ site.name }}, I'm a **{{ site.role | downcase }}** and **teacher**, working as a **digital nomad** while I travel from city to city. Currently I'm working with [Kyokan][kyokan] and, before that, I've worked with other awesome companies like [StudySoup][studysoup], [HE:labs][helabs], [enjoei :P][enjoei], [ESPN Brasil][espn] and [Globo.com][globo].

I'm also creator of [Assando Sites][assando-sites], a project where I taught **Ruby on Rails** and **CakePHP** to more than *450 developers* new frameworks, tools, workflows and techniques.

Furthermore, I deliver fantastic Ruby on Rails apps using **Agile** methodologies, and TDD and CI are the most important tools on my belt.

On my spare time, you can find me between the woods or on the top of some mountains, hiking between the rocks & amazing sightseeing.

*[TDD]: Test Driven Development
*[CI]: Continuous Integration

Hi! My name is {{ site.name }}, I'm a **{{ site.role | downcase }}** and **teacher**, working from my hometown, in the northeast of Brazil.

I've worked with awesome companies like [StellaService][stella], [Kyokan][kyokan], [StudySoup][studysoup], [HE:labs][helabs], [enjoei :P][enjoei], [ESPN Brasil][espn] and [Globo.com][globo].

I'm the creator of [Assando Sites][assando-sites], through which I taught **Ruby on Rails** and **CakePHP** to more than *450 developers* new frameworks, tools, workflows and techniques.

Furthermore, I deliver fantastic Ruby on Rails apps using **Agile** methodologies, and TDD and CI are the most important tools on my belt.

On my spare time, you can find me between the woods or on the top of some mountains, hiking between the rocks & amazing sightseeing.

*[TDD]: Test Driven Development
*[CI]: Continuous Integration

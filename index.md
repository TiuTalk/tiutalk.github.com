Hi! My name is {{ site.name }}, I'm a **{{ site.role | downcase }}** and **teacher**, working as a **digital nomad** while I travel from city to city. Currently I'm working at [HE:labs][helabs] and before that [enjoei :P][enjoei], [ESPN Brasil][espn], [Globo.com][globo] and [Jornal do Brasil][jb].

I'm also creator of [Assando Sites][assando-sites], a project where I teach **Ruby on Rails** and **CakePHP** to other developers. I've taught more than *400 developers* new tools, workflows and techniques, through this project.

Furthermore, I deliver fantastic Ruby on Rails apps using **Agile** methodologies, and TDD and CI are the most important tools on my belt. I have been developing web apps for more than 15 years and I love working in **open-source back-end** projects.

*[TDD]: Test Driven Development
*[CI]: Continuous Integration

Hi! My name is {{ site.name }}, I'm a **{{ site.role | downcase }}** and **teacher**, working as a **digital nomad** while I travel from city to city. I'm used to work with awesome companies like [HE:labs][helabs], [enjoei :P][enjoei], [ESPN Brasil][espn] and [Globo.com][globo].

I'm also creator of [Assando Sites][assando-sites], a project where I teach **Ruby on Rails** and **CakePHP** to other developers. I've taught more than *450 developers* new frameworks, tools, workflows and techniques .

Furthermore, I deliver fantastic Ruby on Rails apps using **Agile** methodologies, and TDD and CI are the most important tools on my belt.

*[TDD]: Test Driven Development
*[CI]: Continuous Integration
